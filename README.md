# Axel Yaguana's website

I'm building my personal website using Django.

It will have all my professional information and a blog in which I'll share my ideas and opinions.

> *This is the `main` branch. Here you'll find the production version of the app.*

Other branches to test new features will be created throughout the developing process. ðŸ˜‰
